## CSRF Protection

### Implementation Details

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection has been implemented using the `csurf` package. The implementation:

1. Creates stateful CSRF tokens tied to the user's session
2. Requires a valid token for all state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
3. Uses secure, HTTP-only cookies with SameSite policy
4. Provides a dedicated endpoint for token generation at `/api/csrf-token`
5. Includes comprehensive error handling and logging for token validation failures

Key implementation files:
- `server/middleware/csrf-protection.ts`: Main implementation
- `server/index.ts`: Integration with application

Usage example for client-side code:
```javascript
// When submitting a form, include the CSRF token
async function submitForm(data) {
  // First fetch a CSRF token
  const tokenResponse = await fetch('/api/csrf-token');
  const { csrfToken } = await tokenResponse.json();
  
  // Then include it in your request
  const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'CSRF-Token': csrfToken
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });
  
  return response.json();
}
```

## Content Security Policy and Secure Headers

### Implementation Details

A comprehensive security headers strategy has been implemented to prevent various attacks including XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing attacks, and more:

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)

1. Sets restrictive CSP headers for all responses
2. Uses nonces for authorized inline scripts
3. Configures policies for various content types (scripts, styles, images, etc.)
4. Provides detailed logging for CSP-related events

Key implementation files:
- `server/middleware/content-security-policy.ts`: Main CSP implementation
- `server/index.ts`: Integration with application

The policy includes:
- Script restrictions: Only allows scripts from trusted sources and those with a valid nonce
- Style restrictions: Only allows styles from trusted sources, with limited inline styles
- Connection restrictions: Controls which domains can be connected to
- Frame restrictions: Prevents clickjacking by controlling which sites can frame the application

#### Additional Security Headers

Beyond CSP, we've implemented comprehensive security headers through the secure headers middleware:

1. X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type
2. X-XSS-Protection: Enables the browser's built-in XSS filtering
3. Strict-Transport-Security: Tells browsers to only access using HTTPS
4. Referrer-Policy: Controls what information is sent in Referer headers
5. X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking attacks
6. Permissions-Policy: Controls browser features that may be used by the page
7. Cache-Control: Prevents sensitive information from being cached
8. Feature-Policy: Restricts which browser features can be used on your site

Key implementation files:
- `server/middleware/secure-headers.ts`: Main secure headers implementation
- `server/index.ts`: Integration with application

## Secure Cookies

### Implementation Details

All cookies set by the application are secured using the secure cookies middleware. The implementation:

1. Intercepts all cookie-setting operations
2. Adds security attributes to cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
3. Prevents modification of cookies with sensitive information
4. Logs all cookie security enhancements
5. Adapts security levels based on the environment (development vs. production)

Key implementation files:
- `server/middleware/secure-cookies.ts`: Main implementation
- `server/index.ts`: Integration with application

Cookie security attributes include:
- `HttpOnly`: Prevents JavaScript access to cookies
- `Secure`: Ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS
- `SameSite=Lax`: Provides CSRF protection while allowing some cross-site functionality

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Implementation Details

Comprehensive input validation and sanitization has been implemented across all routes, with specific focus on the website builder functionality:

1. Path Validation
   - Prevents directory traversal attacks
   - Ensures paths conform to expected formats
   - Validates file paths before any file operations

2. Code Validation
   - Detects and blocks dangerous patterns in code
   - Prevents execution of unsafe operations
   - Validates code before execution or storage

3. Template/Tag Validation
   - Validates template IDs, categories, and tags
   - Prevents excessive number of tags
   - Ensures valid formatting of all template-related inputs

4. Message Validation
   - Validates chat message format and content
   - Limits message size to prevent payload attacks
   - Validates message roles and structure

5. Content Size Validation
   - Limits file size to prevent resource exhaustion
   - Prevents excessively large uploads
   - Sets reasonable limits for different content types

Key implementation files:
- `server/routes-enhanced-website-builder.ts`: Implementation of validation for website builder routes
- `server/utils/security-utils.ts`: Utility functions for input validation

## Rate Limiting

### Implementation Details

Rate limiting has been implemented for sensitive operations to prevent abuse and brute force attacks:

1. AI Operations Rate Limiting
   - Limits AI API calls to prevent resource abuse
   - Sets reasonable limits for chat and code generation operations
   - Uses user ID for rate limiting when available, falling back to IP address

2. File Operations Rate Limiting
   - Limits file read/write operations to prevent abuse
   - Protects against flooding attacks
   - Sets higher limits than AI operations, balancing security and usability

3. Admin Operations Rate Limiting
   - Limits sensitive admin operations
   - Provides additional protection for privileged operations
   - Logs rate limit events for security monitoring

Key implementation files:
- `server/middleware/rate-limit.ts`: Rate limiting middleware implementation
- `server/routes-enhanced-website-builder.ts`: Integration with website builder routes

Rate limit configuration example:
```typescript
const aiOperationsRateLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minute window
  max: 50, // 50 requests per window
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
  keyGenerator: (req) => req.session?.userId?.toString() || req.ip,
  message: { success: false, message: 'Too many AI operations. Please try again later.' }
});
```

## Security Logging

### Implementation Details

Comprehensive security logging has been implemented to track security-relevant events:

1. Standardized Security Context
   - Creates consistent context for all security logs
   - Includes user ID, session ID, IP address, user agent, etc.
   - Provides detailed context for security analysis

2. Security Event Logging
   - Logs all security-relevant events (authentication, access control, etc.)
   - Provides detailed information about security events
   - Uses standardized format for easier analysis

3. Validation Failure Logging
   - Logs all validation failures with detailed context
   - Helps identify potential attacks
   - Provides information for security monitoring

Key implementation files:
- `server/logging.ts`: Core logging implementation
- `server/utils/security-utils.ts`: Security context utilities
- Various route files: Integration with security logging

Security logging example:
```typescript
// Create security context
const securityContext = createSecurityContext(req, {
  action: 'file_access_attempt',
  result: 'failure',
  details: { reason: 'invalid_path' }
});

// Log security event
logSecurity('File access denied due to invalid path', securityContext);
```

## Code Execution Security

### Implementation Details
